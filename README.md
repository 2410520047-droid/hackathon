AI-Based Fake News Detection using NLP
🚀 Problem Statement

Misinformation spreads rapidly across social media platforms. The goal of this project is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based classification system that identifies whether a news article is Fake or Genuine.

🧠 Approach

Data preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Classification using Logistic Regression

Model evaluation using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

📊 Model Performance

Accuracy: 98.99%

Precision: 0.99

Recall: 0.99

F1-Score: 0.99

The model performs consistently across both fake and real news classes.
